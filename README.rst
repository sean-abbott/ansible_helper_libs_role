helper_libs
===========================

Contains a few small helper modules for use in other roles.

Not Ready For Casual Use
------------------------
This is in an incomplete state.  I don't have docs or anything useful
included yet.  Or tests.

But if you think it looks like it would be useful if I added those things,
poke me via an issue and I'll get on it.

Usage
-----

clone this into your roles directory.

Then, use as here: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html#embedding-modules-and-plugins-in-roles

Basically, include it as the first role in your playbook whenever you want access to these modules.
